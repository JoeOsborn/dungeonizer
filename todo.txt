theme: maybe too much freedom.

hero just doesn't feel capable enough -- too floaty perhaps, enemies the wrong sizes, etc.  they should all use box collision.

assign 'monsterness' to arbitrary shapes in bounding boxes.  maybe key by color?

monsters in a toolbox?

numbers that go up on killing monsters, getting princesses, health display

scrolling
distinguish selected/unselected color
distinguish functional/aesthetic colors

minimum draw width

smaller avatar
more to do for dungeoneer and hero
  keys and doors
  builtin monsters
  holes and treasures and monster hives already in the dungeon in various places--static or procedural
    in this case, monsters could all just exist in hives and dungeoneers wouldn't have to draw them
  random dungeon events -- earthquakes, etc
  character creator to give dungeoneer time
  more points for keeping player close to death, but not dead?

two screens?--cintiq?

things that only the hero can see?
